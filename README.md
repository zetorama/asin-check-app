# asin-check-app

So, it was a take-home assignment for a software engineer position from a very nice company.

## Tech Challenge


> Given an Amazon product ASIN (a unique identifier amazon uses for its products), build an application that can fetch the category, rank & product dimensions of that product on Amazon, store that data in some sort of database, and display the data on the front-end. For example, the details for ASIN "B002QYW8LW" can be found [here](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002QYW8LW).
>
> PS. You're probably going to think the best solution for the challenge would be to use Amazon's Product API & you're right - but registering for that is a mission! The API isn't available and you will need to figure out an alternative method :)

## Technology used

- Typescript
- React, Mobx/MST, Bootstrap
